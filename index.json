However, concerns over cell identity remain, and a comprehensive characterization of the cultured CEnC across serial passages has not been performed. To this end, we compared two established CEnC culture methods by assessing the transcriptomic changes that occur during in vitro expansion. In confluent monolayers, low mitogenic culture conditions preserved corneal endothelial cell state identity better than culture in high mitogenic conditions. Expansion by continuous passaging induced replicative cell senescence. Transcriptomic analysis of the senescent phenotype identified a cell senescence signature distinct for CEnC. We identified activation of both classic and new cell signaling pathways that may be targeted to prevent senescence, a significant barrier to realizing the potential clinical utility of in vitro expansion.","tags":null,"title":"Phenotypic and functional characterization of corneal endothelial cells during in vitro expansion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vinay Swamy","David McGaughey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"2dc4a6cfa7aac342304eec12a33e0b31","permalink":"/publication/swamy-eye-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T19:12:12.5813Z","relpermalink":"/publication/swamy-eye-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop an accessible and reliable RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome database of healthy human eye tissues and a matching reactive web application to query gene expression in eye and body tissues.    We downloaded the raw sequence data for 1375 RNA-seq samples across 54 tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project as a noneye reference set. We then queried several public repositories to find all healthy, nonperturbed, human eye-related tissue RNA-seq samples. The 916 eye and 1375 GTEx samples were sent into a Snakemake-based reproducible pipeline we wrote to quantify all known transcripts and genes, removes samples with poor sequence quality and mislabels, normalizes expression values across each tissue, perform 882 differential expression tests, calculate GO term enrichment, and output all as a single SQLite database file: the Eye in a Disk (EiaD) dataset. Furthermore, we rewrote the web application eyeIntegration (available in the public domain at https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov) to display EiaD.    The new eyeIntegration portal provides quick visualization of human eye-related transcriptomes published to date by database version, gene/transcript, 19 eye tissues, and 54 body tissues. As a test of the value of this unified pan-eye dataset, we showed that fetal and organoid retina are highly similar at a pan-transcriptome level, but display distinct differences in certain pathways and gene families, such as protocadherin and HOXB family members.    The eyeIntegration v1.0 web app serves the pan-human eye and body transcriptome dataset, EiaD. This offers the eye community a powerful and quick means to test hypotheses on human gene and transcript expression across 54 body and 19 eye tissues.","tags":null,"title":"Eye in a Disk: eyeIntegration Human Pan-Eye and Body Transcriptome Database Version 1.0EiaD eyeIntegration Database and Web App 1.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ricardo F.

ZEB1 plays an integral role in mediating cell state transitions during cell lineage specification, wound healing and disease. EMT/MET are characterized by distinct changes in molecular and cellular phenotype that are generally context-independent. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), associated with ZEB1 insufficiency, provides a new biological context in which to understand and evaluate the classic EMT/MET paradigm. PPCD is characterized by a cadherin-switch and transition to an epithelial-like transcriptomic and cellular phenotype, which we study in a cell-based model of PPCD generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ZEB1 knockout in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). Transcriptomic and functional studies support the hypothesis that CEnC undergo a MET-like transition in PPCD, termed endothelial to epithelial transition (EnET), and lead to the conclusion that EnET may be considered a corollary to the classic EMT/MET paradigm.","tags":null,"title":"ZEB1 insufficiency causes corneal endothelial cell state transition and altered cellular processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mithun Mitra","Elizabeth L.
