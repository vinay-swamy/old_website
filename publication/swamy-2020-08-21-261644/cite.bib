 abstract = {De novo transcriptome construction from short-read RNA-seq is a common method for reconstructing previously annotated and novel mRNA transcripts within a given sample. However, this process lacks a way to be evaluated as it is difficult to obtain a ground-truth measure of transcript expression. With advances in third generation sequencing, full length transcripts of whole transcriptomes can be accurately sequenced to generate a ground-truth transcriptomeâ€” but it is significantly more expensive than short-read sequencing. We generated long-read Pacbio and short-read Illumina RNA sequencing data from an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (iPSC-RPE) cell line. We use the long-read data to identify simple but powerful metrics for assesing de novo transcriptome construction and to optimize a short-read based de novo transcriptome construction pipeline. We then apply this this pipeline to construct transcriptomes for 340 short-read RNA-seq samples originating from healthy adult and fetal retina, cornea, and RPE to generate the first pan-eye transcriptome annotation. We identify hundreds of novel gene isoforms and examine their significance in the context of ocular development and disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
