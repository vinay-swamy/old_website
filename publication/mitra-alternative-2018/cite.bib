 abstract = {In response to a wound, fibroblasts are activated to migrate toward the wound, to proliferate and to contribute to the wound healing process. We hypothesize that changes in pre-mRNA processing occurring as fibroblasts enter the proliferative cell cycle are also important for promoting their migration.},
